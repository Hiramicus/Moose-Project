How to install:

1. Create these folders: C:\Program Files\TwoGuysInAShed\MooseCalendar

2. Compile all source files and place the class files in that folder.

3. Place the two batch files there also.

4. Make a copy of the RemindersLauncher.bat file and place it in the user's
startup folder. This folder should have a path like this:
C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup

5. Place the shortcut file (MooseCalendar.lnk) on the desktop. That's the
shortcut to the main program.

6. Run the main program at least once. You can quit immediately.

7. Run the reminders program at least once. Do so by double-clicking
RemindersLauncher.bat. The command line window that pops up can be closed
without any effects.

Note: Reminders should start appearing the next calendar day.
